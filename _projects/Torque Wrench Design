#### Overview

- Anyone whose used a torque wrench or other hand tool knows that one of the most important attributes of the material and design chosen is life cycle. In choosing a material for my design, I opted for one which I could confidently say would last longer than a user would ever need it, and a design that would never fail them. I chose a low alloy steel, specifically AISI 9255, oil quenched and tempered at 205 degC. I specifically searched for a material that had been tempered and hardened using metal cold, hot, and press forming to remove deformations and imperfections in an otherwise untempered material. The steel has a Young’s Modulus of 31.3E6 psi, yield strength of 327 ksi, Poisson’s ratio of 0.295, and fatigue strength at 106 cycles of 102 ksi.

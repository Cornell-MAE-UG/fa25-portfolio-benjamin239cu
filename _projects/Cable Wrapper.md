In 2025, I worked on a team where we interviewed college students, professors, and engineering professionals to understand what complaints about their work or lifestyles they had in commmon. Using this information, we developed an idea for a cable wrapping device that was portable, robust, and lightwegith enough for travel. We designed the device in 3dFusion, then made multiple prototypes using purchased parts and 3d printed parts, designed by us. We tested each round of prototype until we created our final design which fulfilled the needs of all three groups of people and could be reasonably used in day-to-day life, with tolerances and design in mind for manufacturing on a larger scale.
